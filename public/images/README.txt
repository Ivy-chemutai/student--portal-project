To add a campus background image:

1. Place an image file named "campus.jpg" in this directory
2. The image should be a landscape orientation photo of a campus or educational building
3. Recommended size: 1920x1080 pixels or similar 16:9 aspect ratio
4. The image will be used as a background for the homepage jumbotron and CTA sections

If no image is provided, the application will use a solid purple gradient as a fallback.
